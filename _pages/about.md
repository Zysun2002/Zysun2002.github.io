About me
======

Hello! I am a fourth-year undergraduate in the Tang Ao-qing Honors Program in Computer Science at Jilin University. 

During my undergraduate studies, I have been fortunate to collaborate with Professor Wenbin Liu and Professor Rui Ma at Jilin University, focusing on spatiotemporal data mining and 3D vision, respectively. I also gained valuable experience as a visiting student under the supervision of Professor Zhaopeng Cui at Zhejiang University, where I worked on 3D vision. Additionally, I completed two academic visits to the University of Alberta, where I focused on computer graphics, lasting one month and three months, respectively.

My current research interest involves computer graphics and 3D vision.

This work focuses on enhancing spatial continuity in data mining. Our key contribution is to propose a novel task called "Spatiotemporal Data Reconstruction" which brings the idea from computer vision to infer complete fine-grained spatiotemporal map from incomplete coarse-grained observation. We also propose a two-stage generative model to leverage spatiotemporal characteristics and thus lead to SOTA performance. </details>
